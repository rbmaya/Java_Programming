Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see it's not me,
It's not my family
In your head, in your head they are fighting

With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns

In your head
In your head they are cryin'

In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie
